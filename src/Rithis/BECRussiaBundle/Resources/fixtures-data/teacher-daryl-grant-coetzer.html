<p>I am from South Africa, the rainbow nation, we have 12 official languages and 3 capital cities. Ten years ago I left
    South Africa to embark on a new teaching career after having spent 18 years in the IT industry. I was a computer
    programmer working on mainframe computers.</p>

<p>South Africa is a beautiful country and I used to love going hiking in the mountains and forests. I also used to like
    going to the gym and jogging. In 2000 I ran and finished the comrades marathon, a grueling 90 km race. My other
    hobbies are reading, travelling and I also enjoy watching movies, but my great love is teaching, so work is always a
    pleasure for me.</p>

<p>I have been teaching English since 2001. I have taught English in South Africa, Poland, Russia, China, Kazakhstan,
    Azerbaijan and India. I have worked in various different positions, teacher, senior teacher Ados, Dos and Academic
    Director. I have taught all levels and ages. I have also been an IELTS examiner and local tutor for the IHC.</p>

<p>I really enjoy living and working in the former USSR, it has been a dream of mine to visit and work in Yakutsk, ever
    since I first heard of the place.</p>
